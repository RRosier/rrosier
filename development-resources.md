# Development Resources

A list of various resources (books, sites, blogs, tutorials, ...) I find useful in my journey as a developer.  

## Developers

[The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) - Robert C. Martin  
Not a book about technologies, but about the actual person who writes code. Robert C. Martin uses his 40+ years of experience to describe what it takes to be a *professional developer*. Most of the points I feel myself agreeing to.  
A book every aspiring professional developer should read, and keep it close by to reference to it again when staying professional gets tough.

## Architecture

[Framework Design Guidelines - Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries](https://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Addison-Wesley/dp/0135896460) - Krzysztof Cwalina, Brad Abrams  
A must-have book on your shelve when writing .NET code, especially re-usable and shared libraries, within your project, team, company or worldwide.  
Written by the creators of the .NET Framework, it contains a lot of do and don'ts and falls back on real-life examples during the creation of the framework.  
I just realize there's a new updated 3th edition available.

[Domain Driven Design: Tackle Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - Eric Evans  
Though I've not had the chance to finish this book, the DDD principle comes back over and over again in various development patterns and architecture.  
For example, it is fundamental in successfull MicroServices architecture.  
DDD is a concept every enterprise architect should be familiar with these days.

## Technologies

[Writing High-Performance .NET Code](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-High-Performance-NET-Code-Watson-ebook/dp/B07BF68842) - Ben Watson  
I bought this book because the subject interested me (and it was on sale). The book is hard to read and goes very deep in concepts such as Garbage Collection and other low-level APIs.  
After reading this, you understand a lot more about the internals of .NET and the compiler. It makes you also realize that .NET is not just some high-level framework, but when understanding enough can compete with other low-level languages such as C and C++.

## Various

[Management 3.0 - Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders](https://www.amazon.com/Management-3-0-Developers-Developing-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321712471) - Jurgen Appelo  
I'm not a manager, and never want to be one. But inevatible, when working as a senior developer on large projects, you get to know some of the company's structure.  
I bought this book to help me understand more management, and maybe become a better technology lead. The ideas explained here are very interesting and I can see how things will certainly improve.  
Unfortunatly, I have not seen a practical environment that comes close to it. But it's worth understanding and aiming for it.
